## <span style="color:#81112c">Service Overview</span>

My service activities are focused on contributing to two broad themes. First, enhancing student success in research. Second, creating linkages between my work and the community. These two themes contribute to my research programs mission *"to conduct research that will help design urban and rural environments that equitably increase physical activity for the entire population"* by creating structures through my service that enhance opportunities for highly qualified personnel and by linking my research with the community.

### <span style="color:#81112c">Community Collaborations</span>

I have done considerable work in the community of St. John's and area. Typically, I try and use my expertise in data analysis and healthy cities to help inform discussion about urban planning and traffic issues in St. John's.

For example, in winter of 2019-2020 there were a large number of fatal and severe injuries to pedestrians in St. John's. One of people was Dr. John Shirokoff an Engineering Professor at Memorial University. I was contacted by his sister about how to be involved in advocacy for pedestrian saftey in St. John's (see Appendix 1). As a result,  I conducted some data analysis of pedestrian crashes [https://github.com/walkabilly/sj_crashes/blob/master/avalon_collisions.md](https://github.com/walkabilly/sj_crashes/blob/master/avalon_collisions.md) and was asked to speak at an Emergency Panel on Pedestrian Safety in St. John's organized by the St. John's Social Justice Cooperative. As part of this type of work I often receive communication 

Similarly, a student of mine Asia Holloway released a report titled "Health and economic benefits of walking in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador." The report garnered considerable of media attention. I received correspondence from a Newfoundlander now living in Ottawa who wanted to retire in NL but was concerned that they would not be able to walk safely in their beloved community (see Appendix 2). 

Finally, I was also a member of the Building Healthy Communities Provincial Linkages Committee from 2017 to 2019. This group was convened by the provincial government to plan healthy community initiatives throughout Newfoundland and Labrador.
