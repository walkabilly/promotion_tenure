## <span style="color:#81112c">Teaching Philosophy</span>

My primary intention as a teacher is to create a learning environment in which my students and I can learn together, can understand and critically reflect on threshold concepts in public health. I strive to evoke passion and nuance in my students’ thinking and to promote the integration of concepts and perspective from multiple disciplines. Given the ready availability of information, it is no longer sufficient for students simply to memorize concepts and definitions. The contemporary challenge for both teachers and students involves conceptual exploration and innovations that bring together ideas from multiple disciplines to deepen our understanding of the world, appreciating both complexity and ambiguity. As a teacher I attempt to collaborate with students in creating the best learning environment.
 
To accomplish my teaching and learning outcomes I combine technological innovation, inspiring in-class interactive learning and problem based learning. Technological innovations in my courses include podcasting lectures, online forums and mobile availability of course material. Technology, however, cannot be a substitute for human interaction. My class presentations encourage interactions and critical reflection with and among students, providing conceptual brainteasers for students’ reflection to conclude each class. Students need to recognize that universities are integral community members. Through problem based learning opportunities, students are challenged to engage their knowledge and understanding through reflective practice. Problem based learning allows students to explore and learn firsthand the principles of public health, theory and methods.
 
To assess progress toward my teaching and learning outcomes I draw on students’ evaluations, fellow teachers’ peer evaluations, and my students’ accomplishments in major scholarship competitions. These assessment strategies encourage continuous development of my teaching based on students’ learning. A reflexive approach to teaching and learning demands that I remain self-critical and adapt to meeting the changing needs, competencies, and hopes of my students, the fundamental purpose of my teaching practices.
 
Teaching and learning create remarkable moments in our human experience. From watching the joy of a child ride a bike for the first time to that “aha” moment when a student finally “gets” a challenging concept, such learning moments imprint themselves in our memory. For me, teaching involves that wonder. The hard work of remote and immediate preparation in teaching is transformed into the joy of these indelible learning moments. Although these moments are rare, they are transforming. I am motivated and strive to create such opportunities in each of my courses so that students can experience and prove to themselves they are more and can become more than they have previously believed.

## <span style="color:#81112c">Course Evaluations</span>

CEQ results for HKR 3400 were not available in time for the submission deadline. For HKR 6134 the response rate was too low. However, I did collect my own course evaluation data from the 2 courses I taught in the 2016-2017 academic year. Below I present the survey data and quotes for the `Stop, Start, Continue` activity the students completed as part of the evaluation for HKR 3400 as examples of my teaching. 

#### <span style="color:#81112c">Course Evaluations</span>

The data are from 13 students in HKR 3400 (out of a possible 62 students) and 18 students in HKR 6134 (our of a possible 35). The questions posted were:   
    1. The instructor used challenging questions   
    2. The instructor was willing to listen to student opinions  
    3. The instructor was actively helpful to the students  
    4. The instructor had a genuine interest in student learning  
    5. The course materials (e.g., readings, notes, in‐class exercises) facilitated learning  
    6. The general atmosphere in this course was good for learning  
    7. The instructor related to students in ways that promoted mutual respect  
    8. The instructor provided adequate opportunities for questions and discussion during class time  
    9. Students were invited to share their ideas  
    10. In this course, I felt motivated to learn  
    
Below I present only a subset of the data. However, what is presented provides a good general picture of the evaluations.

  *  knowledgeable instructor and wanted students to engage with the topic
  *  various types of media were used to our attention
  *  the course put a lot of onus on students to follow the topics and stay up to date (which is a big change for undergrad courses) 
  *  Dr. Fuller worked hard to keep us engaged in class material
  *  lots of opportunity to raise your mark
  *  very interesting
  *  I liked that there were many opportunities to give my opinion
  *  I liked not having to the biggest educational components as a group
  *  The instructor was fair and engaging
  *  intersting subject matter
  *  discussion was a good idea though used too often in my opinion and sometimes lacked guidance
  *  challenging students to think and express ideas

#### 2. Describe three elements of this course that need improvement:   
  *  less work in short duration course
  *  more time between lightning talks
  *  lighting talks: attendance, marking, regulations need improvement
  *  notes/materials: more structure learning basis needs to be provided at beginning
  *  A midterm and final paper would be better
  *  guidelines for articles
  *  necessity of lightning talks
  *  feedback for in class projects
  *  less class discussion and more information from professor who is an expert
  *  clearer instructions for assignments
  *  material dry and could not relate
  *  felt like I had to teach myself
  *  even with speaking to the instructor he had inadequate or confusing/conflicting answers
  *  work load for this course needs to be smaller considering it is only 6 weeks

  *  no reason given behind back mark
  *  A lot expected of undergrad students
  *  Dry material
  *  Waiting to long for classes responses was awkward
  *  more time between lightning talks
  *  more focus on certain social determinants
  *  students seemed unwilling to participate, even when questions where easy. I think they felt intimidated by topics and high expectations
  *  participation marks based on group work aren't reflective of other in* class efforts
  *  if left like we only scratched the surface with the topics
  *  I wish we should have learned more for you instead of discussing in groups
  *  better standardized grading among all students
  *  TA's grading was quite harsh in some aspects
  *  overall organization
  *  The grading system for the lightning talks was horrible
  *  wanted to learn not discuss all the time
  *  Class has great potential

#### 3. What have you taken from this course that you will bring forward to your future studies and career:  
  *  encouraging participation is a great way to encourage participation
  *  I was genuinely excited for this course but the course lead/structure/material wasn't what kinesiology/pe/rec students need in a 6 week undergrad course
  *  the major thing I took away from this course were learned in other courses and just fact* repeated in this course
  *  thinking more rationally from different view but keeping attention to detail
  *  say what you mean, as precise as possible
  *  health and wellness is complicated and there are many issues that need to be addressed
  *  keep an open mind to why some people are healthier than others
  *  health is determined by many factors, some of which are out of personal control
  *  not too sure
  *  keep an open mind, you never know what people are struggling with
  *  An understanding of what graduate level studies look like
  *  It was a very interesting course that I enjoyed greatly
  *  I just wish more of peers felt the same and participated
  *  I found the course material to be interesting yet informative
  *  There was enough class engagement that forces students to think about issues
  *  Don't be afraid to ask the prof for help with papers/assignments
  *  Don't leave it up to the judges
  *  sometimes we lack control and much is predetermined
  *  early mistakes will follow you forever and mess up your lifecourse
  *  interesting material and research
