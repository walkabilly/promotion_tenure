# Brief Biography

I have been an assistant professor and Canada Research Chair in Population Physical Activity in the School of Human Kinetics and Recreation at Memorial University of Newfoundland since August 2016. From 2015-2016 I was a limited term assistant professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Saskatchewan. Between 2014 and 2016 I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Community Health and Epidemiology at the University of Saskatchewan and from 2008 to 2014 I was a PhD student in Public Health at *Université de Montréal*. I have taught 10 different courses in kinesiology and public health since 2010. The focus of my teaching has been in two broad areas. First, methodological and statistics courses. Second, capstone and foundational courses in public health and social determinants of health. In 2016 I won the *Most Effective Professor* award voted by the School of Public Health Student Association at the University of Saskatchewan. 

As a former canoe/kayak coach and someone who has been deeply influenced by teachers and coaches throught my life, I a committed to creating a positive learning environment for students in my classes and in my lab. Teaching is always a work in progress but to date I feel as though I have demonstrated a breadth and depth of teaching that is consistent with my committement to lifelong learning.

A critical examination of methodological research issues and quantitative research designs in the field of human kinetics and recreation. Examines and applies a variety of statistical analysis techniques which can be used in a variety of research designs. Emphasis is placed on the interpretation and implications of empirical quantitative research in the field. Students will learn statistics using either R or SPSS.

### <span style="color:#81112c">HKR 6134 Grad Seminar</span>

#### Course Description
**[Course outline](https://walkabilly.github.io/hkr_seminar/)**  
This course provides students with a forum to discuss and debate research methods and skills such as manuscript and grant writting. The course is designed to provide students with both conceptual and practical course content, using a variety of formats, to enhance student learning. 
 
### <span style="color:#81112c">HKR 6130 Computer Applications for Physical Activity Measurement and Intervention</span>

#### Course Description  
**[Course outline](https://github.com/walkabilly/HKR6130_MUN/blob/master/course_outline.md)**  
This course will introduce students to physical activity measurement using accelerometer devices including smartphones, smartwatches. I will also introduce students to measuring spatial location using Global Positioning Systems. The course will explore conceptual aspects of physical activity and spatial location measurement. Students will design, conduct, and analyse data for a small-scale intervention collecting accelerometer measured physical activity and GPS data. Students will learn programming in R and QGIS for spatial analysis methods.  

### <span style="color:#81112c">HKR 3400 Social Determinants of Health</span>

#### Course Description
This course provides students with a social, political, economic, environmental, and cultural perspective on health and health inequalities. A concentrated look at contemporary health issues using the social determinants of health model will equip students with critical skills necessary to consider health issues beyond physical pathologies.

### <span style="color:#81112c">PUBH 840 Public Health Capstone</span>

#### Course Description
This class is designed to be the culminating experience for the MPH program. As such, it integrates content and theory of public health practice as experienced by students through previous course work and practica. It recognizes the 7 core competency domains in public health as defined by the Public Health Agency of Canada and provides opportunities for students to acquire skills in all these domains. In addition, this course will introduce certain topics such as communication and leadership which may not have been formally covered previous in the program. The course is taught by a team of instructors comprised of faculty and other professionals, and uses lectures and interactive methods such as class discussions, case studies and students’ in-class presentations. In addition, students will be required to write a final report.

### <span style="color:#81112c">PUBH 898 Social Epidemiology</span>
#### Course Description
This course is designed to present the topic of social epidemiology. Social epidemiology encompasses the study of relationships between health and a broad range of social factors such as race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sex/gender, etc. Social epidemiology is broadly partitioned into surveillance (i.e., descriptive relationships between social factors and health, tracking of health inequalities over time) and etiology (i.e., causal effects of social exposures on health). This course will broadly cover the definition of social epidemiology, a historical discussion of social epidemiology’s past, causality, topics in social epidemiology (e.g., race/ethnicity) and discuss intervention strategies to act on the social determinants of health. The course is heavily focused on readings and class discussion. Students are expected to read each article for the week and come to class ready to discuss. 

### <span style="color:#81112c">PUBH 804 Foundations of Public Health</span>
#### Course Description
To introduce key concepts related to Public Health and their practical applications in the Public Health field. To review key concepts of biostatistics. 

### <span style="color:#81112c">CHEP 898 Population Health Intervention Research</span>
#### Course Description
The purpose of the course is to review definitions, theories, methods and underlying assumptions of population health intervention research, to examine the evidence-base for evaluating population health interventions, to review local real world interventions and discuss evaluation directions and challenges. Students are expected to be engaged participants and co-learners as this is the first time the course is offered. On-going discussion and evaluation of scope, content and format will be sought as the course is unfolding.

### <span style="color:#81112c">MSO 6068c Multilevel Modeling</span>
#### Course Description
This course aims to allow students to familiarize themselves with the basic concepts and certain methods of multilevel analysis. The concepts of hierarchical structure of databases, fixed and random effects as well as units of analysis will be presented. The limits of hierarchical data analysis techniques based on the linear model are presented and serve to justify the generalization towards a more suitable model for multilevel analyzes. The methods are illustrated throughout the course using examples analyzed mainly using R.

## <span style="color:#81112c">Student Supervision</span>

In my role as the director of the Built Environment and Active Populations (BEAP) Lab, I both supervise graduate students but also also hire and train numerous highly qualified graduate students. I have supervised 9 undergraduate students, 10 graduate students, and 1 postdoctoral fellow. I have also been a committee member for 9 students including 5 PhD students. Notably, Dr. Henry Luan, my former postdoctoral fellow is a currently an assistant professor in Geography at the University of Oregon. One of my MSc students has received CIHR funding. I currently have 2 MSc students with CIHR funding applications under review. 

Related to the BEAP lab I have hired 11 graduate students from multiple disciplines including computer science, geography, public health, anthropology, and politcal science. I spend considerable time and effort training in students at the BEAP Lab. I have developed various training materials including a (lab onboarding guide)[https://github.com/walkabillylab/labguide], which includes philosophy, ethics, and practical research guidance for team members. One previous lab member has is currently a faculty member at the University of Copenhagen. Another lab member is conducting a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Toronto, while another has gone on to a successfull career at Cisco Systems in Toronto.

My primary intention as a teacher is to create a learning environment in which my students and I can learn together, can understand and critically reflect on threshold concepts in public health. I strive to evoke passion and nuance in my students’ thinking and to promote the integration of concepts and perspective from multiple disciplines. Given the ready availability of information, it is no longer sufficient for students simply to memorize concepts and definitions. The contemporary challenge for both teachers and students involves conceptual exploration and innovations that bring together ideas from multiple disciplines to deepen our understanding of the world, appreciating both complexity and ambiguity. As a teacher I attempt to collaborate with students in creating the best learning environment.
 
To accomplish my teaching and learning outcomes I combine technological innovation, inspiring in-class interactive learning and problem based learning. Technological innovations in my courses include podcasting lectures, online forums and mobile availability of course material. Technology, however, cannot be a substitute for human interaction. My class presentations encourage interactions and critical reflection with and among students, providing conceptual brainteasers for students’ reflection to conclude each class. Students need to recognize that universities are integral community members. Through problem based learning opportunities, students are challenged to engage their knowledge and understanding through reflective practice. Problem based learning allows students to explore and learn firsthand the principles of public health, theory and methods.
 
To assess progress toward my teaching and learning outcomes I draw on students’ evaluations, fellow teachers’ peer evaluations, and my students’ accomplishments in major scholarship competitions. These assessment strategies encourage continuous development of my teaching based on students’ learning. A reflexive approach to teaching and learning demands that I remain self-critical and adapt to meeting the changing needs, competencies, and hopes of my students, the fundamental purpose of my teaching practices.
 
Teaching and learning create remarkable moments in our human experience. From watching the joy of a child ride a bike for the first time to that “aha” moment when a student finally “gets” a challenging concept, such learning moments imprint themselves in our memory. For me, teaching involves that wonder. The hard work of remote and immediate preparation in teaching is transformed into the joy of these indelible learning moments. Although these moments are rare, they are transforming. I am motivated and strive to create such opportunities in each of my courses so that students can experience and prove to themselves they are more and can become more than they have previously believed.

# Course Development

I have developped three new courses during my career. The most recent course I would like to highlight is called **Computer Applications for Physical Activity Measurement and Intervention**. This is a gradaute level course where students learn concepts of data science and intervention evaluation applied to wearable device and accelerometer data. I have offered the course twice since 2017. This course has been a great learning experience for me and the students. I can envision this course being transformed to an undergraduate course or modified to meet teaching needs in data science for students who us different types of data. 

I have also developed a Social Epidemiology course and a Population Health Intervention Research both at the graduate level. These courses have each been offered once. The courses were well received by student but unfortunately, I have not had the chance to teach these courses more than once because of career changes during that period. 

# Administrative and committee work

I have done some administrative work related to teaching and learning. I lead a review of university undergraduate statistics courses at Memorial University. This review was in order for the School of Human Kinetics and Recreation to determine appropriate course equivalencies for student requirements related to undergraduate statistics. 

I also participated in a graduate pprogram review for the School of Human Kinetics and Recreation in 2017. This review was designed to revise and refine our graduate programs in order to allow students more rexibility in their MSc course requirements and the ensure that the School would be able to recruit students across a variety of kinesiology and health science disciplines. 

# Educational Outreach

The BEAP Lab participated in the St. John's English Language School District Mini Enrichment Course Program. This program invites high acheiving high school to Memorial University for a two day workshop. I developed a two day course in accelerometer and global positionning systems and data science. 

#### <span style="color:#81112c">Physical Activity Data Science</span>

##### Course Description  
**[Course outline](https://github.com/walkabillylab/physical_activity_data_science)**  
The course will introduce students to the measurement of physical activity using a metabolic cart, and accelerometers and global positioning systems in smartphones and wearable devices. With the data students collect we will introduce basic concepts of data science including reading in data, data visualization, and basic math functions using the R statistical programming language.

# <span style="color:#81112c">Professional Development in Teaching</span>  

I have participated in numerous professional development activities in teaching and learning over the course of my career. Foundational to my teaching philosophy and approach were three courses I participated in 2007 and 2008 during my MSc degree. These course covered topics such as philosophy of science (Graduate Studies and Research 987: Science, Scientists, and Science-Societal Interactions: An introduction to the dynamics of science), teaching and learning (What the best college teachers do reading group), and evidence based teaching (Making Teaching Visible: Practical principles for peer review of teaching). 

I 2019 and 2020 I am participating in a series of teaching and learning courses offered by the  Centre for Innovation in Teaching and Learning at Memorial University. These courses focus on practical guidance for teaching improvement, documenting teaching effectiveness, and getting better feedback from students. 

# Teaching effectiveness

Overall, my teaching evaluations from students are positive and evaluations from BEAP lab highly qualified personnel are very positive. As with anything there is always room for improvement. I have included specific comments from students regarding areas for improvement in my teaching and lab management.

Perhaps the strongest evidence related to my teaching effectiveness comes in the form of emails I have received from students. 

#### Teaching Data Science

> Hi Dr. Fuller,  
> Much appreciated. The grouping within the Geom_smooth called worked.
> In the name of feedback, I must say, I have very much enjoyed the R content in this course. I was quite skeptical to begin, as I had done some programming during my undergrad and hadn't thoroughly enjoyed it.  
>I have been pleasantly surprised!  
>Cheers  
> John Halley


#### Research Training

> Dear Dr. Fuller,  
> I hope you are doing well. I just wanted to let you know how impactful your work with me during my honours thesis has been. I recently got a job as a research assistant where I am writing the literature review for my university’s dean of education. I will be attending a conference in China next year for it. Also, I am going to China for 3 months to do my own research project with a MITACS grant. I wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me get these opportunities indirectly, and more importantly inspiring me to do down the research route. I hope Newfoundland is treating you well and I want you to know how grateful I am. 
> Thanks  
> Sydney Hector

|15 |  the instruction for the assignments were poorly given, a lot of confusion when knowing what was expected. The course could have been offered online with the content. |
|15 |  Too many group assignments and discussions that wasted time. I would have learned more if the professor spent the majority of class time lecturing. This course has great concepts, however I wanted to see more coming from the professor as that is how I learn best. Participation marking was easy marks but unless you are comfortable speaking in front of a class all the time then you may want to avoid it. |
|15 |  Link the book and notes more to the exams |
|15 |  Organziation and feedback provided for draft article, and provide what is expected for midterm |
|15 |  the course material could have been more detailed |
|26 |  Dr. Fuller is very approachable and is overall a nice guy. I know that he is very knowledgeable in his area and I wish he shared his insight more. |

## <span style="color:#81112c">Feedback from Lab Members</span>

__1. How was your overall experience working in the lab?__  

* Very positive and productive.
* It was great! I have learned a lot about how a research is defined, designed and implemented in a respectful, friendly and collaborative environment
* A very lovely experience 
* Totally satisfying. 

__2. How did your fellow lab members make you feel/how did you feel in the lab environment (approachable? Comfortable to talk to? Easy to work with?)__  

* No problems, everyone was kind and easy to talk to.
* The more people are exposed to lab atmosphere the more they understand the harmony and the dynamics of the lab which will end up making them more approachable. This was not the case for some members
* Very approachable whenever I need help/advise/info; everyone in the lab is easygoing and it is absolutely a pleasure to work with the lab members
* Easy to work with
 
__3. What is the most valuable thing you learned?__  

* Learned a great deal about programming and GIS, very helpful for the projects in the lab and my current work.
* Being a team player
* Collaboration and coordination
* Respect and team work. 

__4. What else did you learn?__  

* Working with covifence was an additional skill that was super helpful for projects after I left the lab, and exploring the built environment literature gave me the ability to discuss projects that fall outside my primary interests in a number of conference settings. 
* How to be a good listener
* Sleep behavior and health data

__5. How do you think your work/experience in the lab could have been different?__  

* My work was very independently led, I was comfortable with that approach and enjoyed my time but I can understand if others would be interested in more structure and guidance during the early stages of a project. Of course, this may have been a function of my role, this may not be a generalizable observation. 
* If there were more fun and outdoorsy activities, say once a month, it would help and motivate lab members be even more productive
* Be more focused on one project only at the same time
* if worked in a group of at least three people. 

__6. What would you like to learn that you didn’t get to?__  

* The project and skill development I experienced were very fulfilling, my only wish is that I was able to generate a concrete deliverable during/following my time in the lab. That being said, my time was short, so this may not have been feasible. 
* I guess I have learned so many new things which I cannot think of anything
* Understand more about health data and their analysis

__7. Is there anything else about your experiences that you would like to share?__  

* It was a wonderful opportunity to work in the BEAP lab and I will always be grateful for the experience. All the best in the future!
* You are awesome!
* I really enjoyed working there.
