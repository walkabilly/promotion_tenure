## <span style="color:#81112c">Research Overview</span>

My research involves using mobile health technologies including smartphones and wearable devices to understand and increase physical activity. This work is particularly focused on understanding how the urban environment influences our physical activity and transportation decisions.  

My vision is    

> A physically active Canadian population

My mission is  

> To conduct research that will help design urban and rural environments that equitably increase physical activity for the entire population

## <span style="color:#81112c">Research Leadership</span>

The BEAP (Built Environment and Active Populations) Lab is a multidisciplinary lab that is focused on achieving my vision and mission. The lab is home to students with training in kinesiology, public health, computer science, and anthropology. We have developed detail documentation and introduction to the Lab (https://github.com/walkabillylab/labguide/blob/master/Guide.md).

## SCREEN SHOTS

### <span style="color:#81112c">Speakers Invited to MUN</span>

### <span style="color:#81112c">National Leadership</span>

I am currently the [Neighbourhoods Factors Team co-lead](http://canue.ca/leadership-and-staff/#toggle-id-24) with Dr. Michael Widener, Unviersity of Toronto, of the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE). CANUE is a $5 Million grant funded by the CIHR Institute of Population and Public Health with the vision to:  

  * *Increase scientific understanding of the interactions among the physical features of the urban   environment and health. This understanding will lead to cost-effective actions that promote healthy childhood development and aging, reduce the burden of chronic disease, and minimize the impact of changing environments.*

### <span style="color:#81112c">Workshops</span>

I hosted 2 workshops in 2017-2018.  

1. "The Future of Walkability Measurement in Canada" workshop on attended by 18 researchers from across Canada. November 16 and 17, 2017.
2. "Itinerum Smartphone App" workshop with Dr. Zachary Patterson from Concordia University. Approximately 20 students attended. October 20th 2017. 

## <span style="color:#81112c">Publications</span>

I published 10 peer reviewer scientific articles in 2017-2018. I am the lead author on three of the publications. Two publications were lead by trainnees. I also have 6 publications under review, 2 of which are on second review. 

Authorship norms for my discipline are as follows. First author typically conceptualized the study did the majority of the data analysis and writing. In the case of students (identified in *italics* here) the supervisor is the last author.

## <span style="color:#81112c">Ongoing Projects</span>

##### <span style="color:#81112c">HEROX</span>

HeroX is a series of studies and technologies designed to further research examining the reliability and validity of commercially available wearable devices. This program includes both lab based and free living studies combining multiple devices for measuring physicl activity. 

##### <span style="color:#81112c">Smart Phone Cut Points</span> 

Our study aims to assess the performance of smartphone accelerometers (in Android and iPhone models) in measuring physical activity intensity and duration in controlled laboratory conditions. Our specific objectives are to:   
    * Assess a variety of individuals. We aim to recruit a gender-balanced sample of 25 children aged 10-14 years and 25 adults (one of their parents or guardians).  
    * Develop cut-points for smartphone accelerometers. Cut-points are needed so that we can assign the appropriate physical activity intensity (i.e., light, moderate, vigorous) to the “movement counts” recorded by the smartphone accelerometers. 

##### <span style="color:#81112c">ITHIM</span> [https://github.com/ITHIM/ITHIM-R/](https://github.com/ITHIM/ITHIM-R/)

The Integrated Transport Health Impact Model (ITHIM) is a mathematical model that integrates data on travel patterns, physical activity, fine particulate matter, GHG emissions, and disease and injuries based on population and travel scenarios. The model calculates the health impacts of walking and bicycling short distances usually traveled by car or driving low-emission automobiles. I am contributing to development of an R package that will implement the ITHIM model. 

##### <span style="color:#81112c">CANUE</span> [http://www.canue.ca/](http://www.canue.ca/)

I am a co-lead (with Dr. Michael Widener) of the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE) Neighbourhood Factors Group. CANUE will gather and develop measures of environmental factors for every neighbourhood across Canada. Dr. Widener and I will work with CANUE to prepare data, supervise students, and organize conferences related to neighbourhoods and health research in Canada.

##### <span style="color:#81112c">INTERACT</span> [http://www.teaminteract.ca/](http://www.teaminteract.ca/)

The INTErventions, Research, and Action in Cities Team (INTERACT)  is a national research collaboration of scientists, urban planners, and engaged citizens uncovering how the design of our cities is shaping the health and wellbeing of Canadians from coast to coast.  Seeing the city as a living laboratory, we use innovative tools that harness the power of mobile technology and interactive mapping to measure the impact of changes in urban infrastructure on people’s physical activity, social participation, and wellbeing, and inequalities in these outcomes. By enabling cities to understand the health impact of their investments, our research aims to inspire healthy and sustainable urban development that will leave a lasting impact on population health and health equity in Canada.

##### <span style="color:#81112c">BikeMaps.org</span> [https://bikemaps.org/](https://bikemaps.org/)

Only ~30% of bike collision data are collected and there is no centralized reporting system. BikeMaps.org is a unique tool that let's citizens build a database by mapping their riding experience. The BikeMaps.org team will analyze data to determine factors that influence cycling safety. We also have plans to build tools to help people plan safer routes and to transfer these to planners in your area.

##### <span style="color:#81112c">Seasonality and active Saskatoon kids</span> [SASK](http://spheru.ca/research_projects/projects/seasonality-active-saskatoon-kids.php)

Seasonality and Active Saskatoon Kids (SASK) is an obesity intervention research project that aims to measure and identify locations where physical activity occurs in Saskatoon, across all seasons, among children aged 10-14 years. Using both a self-reported activity questionnaire and accelerometers, the research team will learn about children's active and sedentary activities at school, at home and within the community. 

##### <span style="color:#81112c">International BicycleShare Impacts on Cycling and Collisions</span> [IBICCS](http://www.lisegauvin.com/fr/projets/bixi-multi-villes-2)

The IBICCS study aims to examine the impact of PBSP on population-levels of cycling and risk of collisions between cyclists and motor vehicles in North America. Data collection for this study is complete but there are many opportunities for data analysis.
